# LaptopSimulator2015
If you don't have `LaptopSimulator2015/Resources/fans.wav` , you can replace it with any sound that reminds you of old PCs fans.
# Building
Either run `make full` or build the solution in Visual Studio. You will not be able to use the Designer until the project is built at least once.
